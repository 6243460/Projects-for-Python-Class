Problems we faced:
During this project we faced many problems. One of the main things was getting our microphone to detect our claps properly. It would often detect the background noise which was inconvenient since 
it would make the microphone not detect any of our clapss. What we did as a solution was first add threshold. Later on we added commands called Smooth sample and Floor noise which sets sets how many analog samples
to average for a smoother mic value reading and the noise floor was set as an integer that helps calibrating the microphone. Lastly, in order to ensure everything works correctly we even added timing gaps between
claps, a cooldown anda  timeout. 

Another issue we faced was with the microphone itself, the microphone would detach from the board its from and we had to solder it back together. There was a also a sensitivity potentiometer that we had to play
around with to set the sensitivity accordingly to our project.
