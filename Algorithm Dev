Raspberry Pi: 

BEGIN
  Connect to MQTT broker at IP 192.168.0.10
  Subscribe to topic "thanos/clap_data"

  WHEN a message is received:
      Decode JSON message
      Extract pattern and average_period

      IF pattern = 1 THEN
          command ← "LED_OFF"
          brightness ← 0
      ELSE IF pattern = 2 THEN
          command ← "LED_ON"
          brightness ← 80
      ELSE IF pattern = 3 THEN
          command ← "BRIGHTNESS_UP"
          brightness ← MAX(40, 100 − (average_period × 60))
      ELSE IF pattern = 4 THEN
          command ← "BRIGHTNESS_DOWN"
          brightness ← MIN(80, (average_period × 80))
      ELSE
          command ← "NO_ACTION"
          brightness ← 0
      END IF

      Create a control message with command and brightness
      Publish control message to topic "thanos/led_control"
      Display message sent on screen
  END WHEN
END

In this outline of the Pseudocode, the raspberry pi will receive the data from the claps from the ESP32 and sends a LED control command based on the "patterns"
